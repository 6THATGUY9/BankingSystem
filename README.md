# BankingSystem
This simple Java program uses a command line interface to communicate to the user a bank under the name "FEDERAL BANK OF ZURGEN"


The user is presented with four options, "Withdraw", "Deposit", "Check Balance", and "Exit"


These are pretty simple and straight-to-the-point choices that are most likely to be shown on ATMs and other financial transaction-related machines
